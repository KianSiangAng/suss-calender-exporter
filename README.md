# suss-calender-exporter
Export Course Timetable from SUSS e-services onto your calender

Log in to SUSS e-services -> Course Timetable

Copy Your timetable

Paste it onto the website -> Preview -> Download .ics

Import the .ics file to the calender of your choice.

Tip: Import into a seperate calender, so it's easier to remove and reupload in the event of changes to the timetable

Added an option to export single mod timetable only. (Requires user to input module code and course code manually as they do not exist in the timetable column)
